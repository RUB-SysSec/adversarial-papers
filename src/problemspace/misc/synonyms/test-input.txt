This is a text about network intrusion detection, yet it should not be about
intrusion detection but a different topic: malware analysis.  To make this
change possible, we also investigate aspects related to intrusion detection
and malware analysis.  For example, the analysis of network packets has
several similarities with the inspection of code.  Similarly, botnets can
often be detected with both systems.  Also apts are a good target for these
approaches and a corresponding code analysis.
